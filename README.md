####  dirSize($dir)
This gives the size of a whole folder/directory as specified as $dir. It returns the human readable format of the file size using the below function.

####  human_filesize($bytes)

Below is an example of codes that can guide on how to initiate and use chocolate as a class

````
$a = new akintunde102\chocolatephp\chocolate;

$string = 'All versions of PHP that support namespaces support three kinds of aliasing or importing: aliasing a class name, aliasing an interface name, and aliasing a namespace name. PHP 5.6+ also allows aliasing or importing function and constant names.';
$wordsreturned = 20;

$a->shorten_words($string, $wordsreturned); //Function example, You can use other functions in the class in the same way

````

## Courier Class
This class is majorly for performing mail operations. Below is an example of codes that can guide on how to initiate and use the courier the class

````
$courier = new akintunde102\chocolatephp\courier;
$courier->sender = 'Example.Com <no-reply@example.com>'; //sender's email	
$courier->recipient = $to; //recipient's email
$courier->subject = $title; //email title
$courier->message_text = $courier_txt; //the text format of the email 
$courier->message_html = $sentence['full_html'];	//the html format of the email 
if ($courier->send($courier)){echo 'Email sent';}; //then it gets sent
````

$string = 'All versions of PHP that support namespaces support three kinds of aliasing or importing: aliasing a class name, aliasing an interface name, and aliasing a namespace name. PHP 5.6+ also allows aliasing or importing function and constant names.';

$wordsreturned = 20;

$sh = $a->shorten_words($string, $wordsreturned);

echo $sh; 

//Initiating and Using the Courier Class
$courier = new akintunde102\chocolatephp\courier;
$courier->sender = 'Example.Com <no-reply@example.com>'; //sender's email	
$courier->recipient = $to; //recipient's email
$courier->subject = $title; //email title
$courier->message_text = $courier_txt; //the text format of the email

?>
````


## Testing
To test the libary before use, follow the steps below:
1) Go to vendor\akintunde102\chocolate-php\example and copy the index.php
2) Paste the index.php to main directory
3) Then you can test the codes from your browser or command line as you may like

                                       OR 
1) Create a file in the main directory and name it (for instance,'test.html')
2) Then copy the codes below into the file
````php


<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$a = new akintunde102\chocolatephp\chocolate;

$string = 'All versions of PHP that support namespaces support three kinds of aliasing or importing: aliasing a class name, aliasing an interface name, and aliasing a namespace name. PHP 5.6+ also allows aliasing or importing function and constant names.';
$wordsreturned = 20;

$a->shorten_words($string, $wordsreturned);

echo $a->checkPHP('errorfile');

echo '<br/><br/>';


echo $a->checkDomain('timiweb.com');

echo $a->dirSize('vendor/');

if ($a->IsIPValid('10.199.212.2')){echo 'IP is valid';}
else {echo 'IP is invalid';}



//Initiating and Using the Courier Class
$courier = new akintunde102\chocolatephp\courier;
$courier->sender = 'Example.Com <no-reply@example.com>'; //sender's email	
$courier->recipient = $to; //recipient's email
$courier->subject = $title; //email title
$courier->message_text = $courier_txt; //the text format of the email 
$courier->message_html = $sentence['full_html'];	//the html format of the email 
if ($courier->send($courier)){echo 'Email sent';}; //then it gets sent
